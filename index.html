			                	<p>Market United is digital marketing agency. I mainly worked on a custom built PHP CMS. There was wide selection of work from Java e-commerce sites to .net application to streamline work. There was a strong emphasis to do whatever is needed to make clients happy.</p>
			                    <p>Projects usually lasted around 3 - 4 weeks, with the odd longer lasting project. Teams sizes were generally around 3 people, some projects required to be completed by myself.</p>

						While I was at Market United, I managed to work on the Murdoch Univeristy CMS (Custom built PHP CMS). Some of the key acompleshments I made during my time working on the project are:
						<ul>
							<li>Added the concept of virtual pages. Murdoch has a core database which manages course infomation, they also have many school who want to manage content for their individual pages. The virtual pages allow all the basic info to be populated from the core database, then allow indiviudal schools to override parts of there pages. This allows a consistant level of information across there entire site and gives school who want to be more engaged to be.</li>
						</ul>

					<p><strong>The Task: </strong>I came onto this project to migrate the site from version 1 of the Market United CMS to version 2. This type of upgrade had not occured before and all the data had to stay as it was.</p>
					
					<p>
						<strong>Achievments: </strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Several scripts were written to migrate data, this was not just a different schema but some of the actual data had to be rewritten to match the new system.</li>
							<li>Burswood has custom modules built for the cms (managing of venues and promotions). These modules were rewritten to match the new system but managed to use the existing data.</li>
							<li>No down time when the upgrade was made live.</li>

						<strong>The Task: </strong>Synergy's first steps into social media. They wanted a site that allows users to share energy saving tips.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of the key things I worked on were:
						<ul>
							<li>Custom google maps</li>
							<li>
								<p>Clustering and grouping by type of google markers. When zoomed out rather than cluttering the page with lots of marks they get merged together, zooming in will seperate the markers.</p>
								<p>Users can also sort tips in real time based on type of tip wether they are home, community or work.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Map animation - when left for a period of time the map will automatically animate through different tips</li>
						</ul>

					<p><strong>The Task: </strong> Build a cms backed website for CRCS so the client could display information about their school and courses.</p>
					
					<p>I worked with another freelancer on this project. He did all the designs and flash builds, I did all the server management, html template build and setting up of the cms</p> 
					
					<p>The cms used was <a href="http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/">CMS Made Simple</a>. This was chosen because of the simplicity to create templates and easability of managing content. Extra modules had to be written to manage course information and newsletters.</p>
